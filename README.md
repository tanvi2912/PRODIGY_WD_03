This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other in a grid of 3x3 cells. The objective is to form a line of three symbols (either ❌ or ⭕) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
